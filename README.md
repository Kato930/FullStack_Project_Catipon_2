For this activity, I updated the project into FullStack_Project_Catipon_2. The main difference here is that I added a new page called examples.php to show the examples for REST, WEB, and SOAP protocols as requested. You can find the button for those deliverables on the main dashboard after logging in. The setup is the same as the last one: just move the folder to your htdocs and import the new user_system.sql file into phpMyAdmin so the users and table structure show up. I'm still using the default 'root' and no password for the connection in auth.php so it's ready to go for grading on any XAMPP setup.
